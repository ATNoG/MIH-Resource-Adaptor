MIH Resource Adaptor for Mobicents JAIN SLEE

Description
-----------

MIH Resource Adaptor (RA) is the JAIN SLEE 1.1 RA for the MIH Protocol, which
can be used in Mobicents JAIN SLEE platform.

At the moment, it is only responsible for network I/O operations and
interaction with JAIN SLEE Service Building Blocks (SBBs), allowing SBB to
receive and to send MIH messages. The management of connection between peers
is still made by ODTONE-MIHF, which is the parent project of this RA. In the
future, we prented to support the management of connection between peers
directly in the MIH RA.
